# Doppler CLI configuration example
# Copy this file to .doppler and update with your configuration
#
# Important: Local development and production deployment use separate Doppler configs:
# - Local development: Use your own/default config (development, dev, personal env, etc.)
# - Production deployment: ONLY uses 'prd' config (see Makefile deploy targets)
#
# This file is for local development only. For production, Doppler is configured
# in the Makefile deploy targets which explicitly use --config prd
