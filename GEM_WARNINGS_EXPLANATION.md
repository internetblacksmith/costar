# Bundle Gem Warnings Explanation

## Issue
When running `bundle exec rspec`, you may see warnings related to the `axe-core-api` gem:

```
/home/jabawack81/.rbenv/versions/3.4.7/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/gems/axe-core-api-4.11.0/lib/loader.rb:2: warning: loading in progress, circular require considered harmful
/home/jabawack81/.rbenv/versions/3.4.7/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/gems/axe-core-api-4.11.0/lib/chain_mail/chainable.rb:12: warning: method redefined; discarding old within
```

And a warning about `benchmark` gem:

```
/home/jabawack81/projects/movie_together/spec/performance/performance_spec.rb:4: warning: benchmark was loaded from the standard library, but will no longer be part of the default gems starting from Ruby 3.5.0.
```

## Why These Warnings Occur

### 1. axe-core-rspec Circular Require Warnings
The `axe-core-rspec` gem (version 4.11.0) has a known design issue where it uses circular requires in its chain_mail dependency. This is an internal gem design issue, not a problem with our code.

**Status**: These warnings are **benign** and do **NOT** affect test functionality. They come from the gem's initialization process and are purely informational warnings from Ruby.

### 2. benchmark Gem Warning  
Ruby 3.5+ removes `benchmark` from the standard library. The `spec/performance/performance_spec.rb` file requires it.

**Fix Applied**: Added `gem "benchmark", "0.2.0"` to the test group in `Gemfile`. This gem is now explicitly required and will continue to work in Ruby 3.5+.

## Test Verification

Despite these warnings, **all tests pass successfully**:

```
487 examples, 0 failures, 8 pending
Coverage: 78.55%
```

The warnings appear during gem loading but do not affect test execution or results.

## Why We Don't Suppress Warnings

These warnings come from:
1. **Bundle/Bundler initialization** (before our code runs) - axe-core-api circular require
2. **Gem dependencies** - not our code
3. **External warnings** - generated by gems themselves

Attempting to suppress these would require monkeypatching Ruby's warning system, which is not recommended and would hide legitimate warnings from our own code.

## When These Warnings Don't Appear

- Running tests without the `-W` flag or with warning suppression
- Running only specific test files that don't load axe-rspec
- Running in production (these are development/test only)

## Gems Involved

- **axe-core-rspec** (4.11.0): Accessibility testing framework
  - Uses axe-core-api (4.11.0) which has the circular require issue
  
- **benchmark** (0.2.0): Performance measurement tool
  - Added to maintain Ruby 3.5+ compatibility

## Conclusion

These warnings are **expected and harmless**. They don't indicate any problem with the test suite or the application. All tests run successfully and pass all assertions.

If you want to suppress the warnings when running tests:
- Use: `bundle exec rspec 2>&1 | grep -v "warning:"`
- Or run tests via CI/CD which typically filters gem warnings
