# JustWatch Logo Usage Request - Email Draft

**Subject:** Logo Usage Guidelines Request - ScreenThread Project

---

Dear JustWatch Team,

I am the developer of **ScreenThread**, a web application that helps users discover the connections between actors and movies. The app finds films where two selected actors have appeared together, and can also find common actors between two movies.

## How we currently integrate with JustWatch

When users find a movie they're interested in, we provide a "Where to Watch" link that directs them to JustWatch's search page for that film (e.g., `https://www.justwatch.com/us/search?q=Movie+Title`). This helps our users easily find legitimate streaming options for the movies they discover.

## Our request

We would like to use the JustWatch logo/icon alongside this link to clearly indicate where users will be directed, improving the user experience and properly attributing your service. We want to ensure we follow your branding guidelines and have your permission before doing so.

## About the project

- **Website:** [your-url-here]
- **Data source:** Movie data comes from TMDB (The Movie Database)
- **Purpose:** Help movie fans discover connections between actors and movies
- **Business model:** Currently free to use; we are exploring potential monetization options (such as advertising) in the future

## Questions

1. Whether we may use the JustWatch logo to identify links to your platform?
2. If yes, are there specific logo assets and guidelines we should follow?
3. Any attribution requirements we should include?
4. Whether our potential future monetization would affect logo usage permissions?

Thank you for your time and for providing such a valuable service to movie fans worldwide.

Best regards,
